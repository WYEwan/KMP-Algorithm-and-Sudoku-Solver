### Homework0101: Sudoku Solver

#### Assignment Requirements

**Required Questions**

Given the Sudoku puzzle shown above, if any two digits are removed, the number of solutions will increase. Please write a program to determine: Which two digits (positions) should be removed to yield the maximum number of solutions, and what is the maximum number of solutions?

**Open-ended Question**

How many possible solutions are there for a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle?

**Submission Requirements:**

1. Submit the source code file and a Word document.
2. The source code file should be a compilable and runnable C language program, with comments included.
3. The Word document should include:
   - A description of the solution approach.
   - The answers to the questions.
   - Screenshots of the program's output.

### Homework0201: KMP Algorithm

#### Assignment Requirements

Based on the content of the attached file "test.txt" (100 MB in size, consisting only of lowercase letters without any symbols or other content), answer the following questions:

1. Does the file contain the substring "zhongguo"? If so, where does it appear, and how many times?
   - How many times does the substring "deff" appear, and where are its positions?
2. What is the longest single-letter repetition sequence in the file (e.g., "aaaaaaa" or "bbbbbbbbbbbbbb")? Which letter is it, what is its length, and where does it appear?
3. If we randomly select any three-letter substring "xxx," which substring appears most frequently, and which appears least frequently? How many times do they appear?
4. Implement the KMP algorithm in your program.

Homework0201开头的文件是用于解决KMP问题的

作业要求

•	根据附件文件“test.txt”内容，该文件大小为100M，全部为小写字母构成，没有符号等其它内容，回答以下问题：
1.	文件中是否出现“zhongguo”，出现在哪，出现了多少次；文件中“deff”，出现了多少次，分别在哪些位置。
2.	文件中出现最长的单个字母重复序列是哪个字母，长度多少，位置在哪？如“aaaaaaa”，“bbbbbbbbbbbbbb”。
3.	若任意取3个字母构成一个字符串“xxx”，哪个字符串出现次数最多，哪个字符串出现次数最少，分别多少次。
4.	
•	编程实现KMP算法；
